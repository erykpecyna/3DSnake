Running our project in Unity is simple considering that Unity provides its own IDE for coding and also allows for the running of the
game code in the same unity environment. Download the project file called “Snake” that has been submitted into CS50.me. Open Unity
and open the file called “Snake” that you just downloaded. There will be an outer folder in the Project tab called Assets. Open
this folder. You will see 5 folders within Assets named Downloaded…, Fruits_Packs, etc. The folder that you need to open is called
Scenes. In Scenes, there will be 5 scenes with the Unity Application symbol on them. 2 out of the 5 scenes are necessary for playing
the game.To start 3D snake in which the player (you) are able to manipulate the snake, double click on the menu scene and press the
play button in the top of the unity window. You should see a menu with a map size select. The map sizes are 11x11, 33x33, and 55x55.
11x11 is the best for player testing while 33x33 and 55x55 will be more applicable to the Dumb AI. However, feel free to try the
larger maps. Realistically, it will turn into finding the apple rather than real snake with such a large map size. Once you have
decided on the map size, click that option on the screen and start playing the game. Use the arrow keys to navigate. The up key means
turning upwards, down means turning downwards, left means turning left, and right means turning right. Once you run into an apple
(eat the apple), the size of the snake will increase by one. The goal is to not run into your own tail or the wall while still
collecting apples.
After you hit a wall or your tail, you will be sent back to the home screen, where your last score will be displayed (number of
apples eaten). From here, you can play again by using the same instructions as before for picking the map size. To end the game,
simple press the play button again, and the game will stop. To pause mid game, press the pause button on the top of the unity window
(next to the play button).
The second half of this project is the creation of a Dumb AI, which is named as such because it does not use a neural network but
instead essentially has the snake seek the apple through conditional logic. For this, in the scene folder, double click on AI menu
and press the play button. Select the map size that you want the AI snake to play on by clicking small, medium, or large. From here,
just watch the snake move and collect apples.
Make sure to download all of the files submitted and have it saved under one folder. Otherwise, the game will not have all of the
necessary files to render images and do other important tasks.

Hope you enjoy the game!!
